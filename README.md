# ROAM
Short for **Ro**tor's **A**UR **M**anager.

***

## Prerequisites
Any packages you'd need for AUR, essentially just the base-devel package and git.

***

Run `git clone https://github.com/4rotr/roam.git`, then enter the `roam` directory. Run `chmod +x roam`, and you will be ready to run ROAM.

***

## Usage
`roam <package name>` installs a package. That's really it as of now.
